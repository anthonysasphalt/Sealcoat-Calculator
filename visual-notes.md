# Visual Review Notes

The app is rendering well. Key observations:

1. Hero section: Parking lot image with dark overlay, gold branding, clear title and subtitle
2. Two-panel layout working: form sections on left, sticky results on right
3. Results panel shows: $0.69/sqft recommended price, $0.41 total cost, $0.27 margin
4. Cost breakdown bars with color coding visible
5. Monthly Volume section at bottom of results panel shows totals
6. All 7 sections visible with correct subtotals
7. Footer visible at bottom

The layout looks clean and professional. Ready for checkpoint and delivery.
